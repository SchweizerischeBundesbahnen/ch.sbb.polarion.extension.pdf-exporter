* Source HTML dependency: This extension relies on HTML generated by Polarion (e.g., LiveDoc, Live Report, Test Run).
* Standards compliance adjustments: Polarion’s HTML output is not always compliant with W3C specifications. To ensure usable PDFs, we normalize and repair the HTML before rendering. These modifications range from cosmetic fixes to structural changes when necessary.
* PDF rendering engine: PDF generation is performed by WeasyPrint, which adheres to web standards. Its behavior is outside our control.
* No guarantee of fidelity: We cannot guarantee that every conversion will be perfectly accurate. Please review each generated PDF to verify that document structure and content are preserved as expected.
* User responsibility and feedback: You are responsible for validating the output for your use case. If you encounter issues, please report them with sample input and environment details (Polarion version, extension version, WeasyPrint version).
