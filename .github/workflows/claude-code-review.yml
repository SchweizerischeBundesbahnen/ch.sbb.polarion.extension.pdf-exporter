            Review the PR diff. Report ONLY actual problems in changed lines.
            FOCUS ON:
            - Bugs or logic errors
            - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass, secrets exposure)
            - Breaking changes not mentioned in PR description
            - Missing tests for new functionality
            - Critical performance issues introduced by changes
            DO NOT:
            - Review unchanged code, style/formatting, optional improvements, or provide praise
            - Run build tools (Maven, npm, gradle, etc.)
            - Check external dependency versions
            GUIDELINES:
            - Use Read/Grep/Glob to search the codebase for context
            - If you need to understand parent classes or dependencies, search for usage patterns
            - The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory
            - Post your review using `gh pr comment` as a top-level PR comment
            - Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages
            FORMAT (be TERSE):
            ## Issues Found

            ### 🔴 Critical
            - `file:line` - Problem description - Fix: specific solution

            ### 🟡 Important
            - `file:line` - Issue description - Suggestion: specific fix
            If NO issues found: "✅ No issues found."
