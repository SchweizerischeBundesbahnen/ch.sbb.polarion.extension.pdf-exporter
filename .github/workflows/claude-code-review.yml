            - Breaking changes not mentioned in PR description
            - Missing tests for new functionality
            - Critical performance issues introduced by changes
            Format (be TERSE):
            ## Issues Found

            ### 🔴 Critical
            - `file:line` - Problem description - Fix: specific solution

            ### 🟡 Important
            - `file:line` - Issue description - Suggestion: specific fix
            If NO issues found: "✅ No issues found."
            DO NOT review: unchanged code, style/formatting, optional improvements, or provide praise.
            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.
